# Global collaboration for causal reasoning of host response to coronavirus infection
This is a public repo for global collaboration for causal reasoning of host response to coronavirus infection, to
help the scientific community fight COVID-19 pandemic. 

## How to participate in this effort

### Step 1. Data collection from different domains using certain data standards

Data from different source will have to be cleaned to generate standardized data format to construct the comprehensive knowledge graph for analysis and modeling

### Step 2. Merge all tables to generate comprehensive COVID-19 knowledge graph

Using a python pandas script to merge all tables on respective keys

### Step 3. Advanced Analysis

Perform basic data aggregation an analytic exercise to understand the nature of the graph

### Step 4. Construct comprehensive learning model to predict the causal reasoning map for different 


### Step 5. Research endpoints

1. Viral-host knowledge graph based on literature citations
-Validate Causaly assertions
-Provide false positives and false negatives as feedback to Causaly
-Integrate Causaly assertions with general knowledge of innate immune response and related pathways
2. data-driven Viral-host interaction network based on pharmacological, biochemistry, and other data domains
-Learn molecular signatures to map this data to the viral-host knowledge graph
-Fill in gaps in knowledge graph
-Causal reasoning over the integrated knowledge and data graph
3. Predict determinants of viral pathogenesis
identify targets (or combinations of targets) for medical countermeasures
