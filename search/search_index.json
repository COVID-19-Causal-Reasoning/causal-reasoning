How to participate in this effort Step 1. Data collection from different domains using certain data standards Data from different resources will have to be cleaned to generate standardized data format to construct the comprehensive knowledge graph for analysis and modeling Step 2. Merge all tables to generate comprehensive COVID-19 knowledge graph Using a python pandas script to merge all tables on respective keys Step 3. Advanced Analysis Perform basic data aggregation an analytic exercise to understand the nature of the graph Step 4. Construct comprehensive learning model to predict the causal reasoning map for different requests Step 5. Research endpoints Viral-host knowledge graph based on literature citations -Validate Causaly assertions -Provide false positives and false negatives as feedback to Causaly -Integrate Causaly assertions with general knowledge of innate immune response and related pathways data-driven Viral-host interaction network based on pharmacological, biochemistry, and other data domains -Learn molecular signatures to map this data to the viral-host knowledge graph -Fill in gaps in knowledge graph -Causal reasoning over the integrated knowledge and data graph Predict determinants of viral pathogenesis identify targets (or combinations of targets) for medical countermeasures For general questions, please post them at the issue section of this repo. You're welcome to join our discussion for any scientific subject, feature request and bug report.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#global-collaboration-for-causal-reasoning-of-host-response-to-coronavirus-infection","text":"This is a public repo for global collaboration for causal reasoning of host response to coronavirus infection, to help the scientific community fight COVID-19 pandemic.","title":"Global collaboration for causal reasoning of host response to coronavirus infection"},{"location":"#how-to-participate-in-this-effort","text":"","title":"How to participate in this effort"},{"location":"#step-1-data-collection-from-different-domains-using-certain-data-standards","text":"Data from different resources will have to be cleaned to generate standardized data format to construct the comprehensive knowledge graph for analysis and modeling","title":"Step 1.
